# Summerfield-api

Api used by Summerfield app: https://summerfield.app.br/

Summerfield is an application aimed at the study of English, where the main focus is to acquire vocabulary that in my opinion studying English for some years now is by far the most important skill that must be developed to learn any language.

I developed this application mainly to learn new technologies like Vue.js / Nuxt and build a tool that I find helpful for me and other people.

Technologies used:
• Node.js (express)
• Nuxt.js
• Vuetify
• MongoDb
